Solutions for the excercises in Richard Bird's book "Introduction to functional
programming using haskell".

I'll be adding as I get to solve them. I'm learning in the process so don't
assume everything is correct. Any criticism, corrections or possible solutions
are always welcome :)

Solutions for the first three chapters won't be done since you can just ask for
them by mailing the author.
