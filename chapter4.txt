Following the explanations in the book and looking at the examples,

be guessed.

        Which is nondecreasing since it has only one element.
Case(y:ys)
        If y:ys was not nondecreasing, the implication would be trivially true,
        so we analyze the case when it is nondecreasing.

        takeWhile (<=x) (y:ys) ++ [x] ++ dropWhile (<=x) (y:ys)

    Case(y <= x)

The function f is applied k times on a list of length k in the evaluation of foldr.

Changing the amount of terms on the list changes the accuracy.

convert was already done in exercise 4.1.4
Proving folde f e = foldl f e . convert, by the principle of extensionality,
is the same as proving that:
    folde f e xs = (foldl f e . convert) xs
We prove it by induction on xs.

scanr1 :: (a -> a -> a) -> [a] -> [a]
scanr1 f = map (foldr1 f) . tails1
By the principle of extensionality, this is equivalent to:
scanr1 f xs = (map (foldr1 f) . tails1) xs
