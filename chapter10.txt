10.1.1)
m >> n = m >>= \_ -> n

10.1.2)
Prints a list of characters as string.
As an example:
    (foldl (>>) done . map putChar) "hi" =
    putChar 'h' >> putChar 'i' >> done

10.1.3)
getChar takes a Char as input, and returns it.
getChar >>= return takes a Char as input, and when returning that Char as
output, it is given to the function return as input, which then returns its'
value.
In other words, both do the same, suggesting that return is the right unit of (>>=).

10.1.4) It prints the character '!'. This suggest that return is a kind of left
unit for (>>=) (as stated on page 343)
